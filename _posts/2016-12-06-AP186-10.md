title: Histogram manipulation (AP186 A10)

**Do not trust your eyes!**

This warning faced me as I began going over the manual for this activity. Apparently, cameras are able to capture information beyond what can be seen by the human eye; unseen information just on the fringes of our own perception.

Here, we perform gray-level histogram manipulation to increase the dynamic range of images with bright points washing out the details of dark areas. Here we want to be able to see information from the dark parts, for one reason or another, by manipulating the cumulative gray-level response to conform to one or another desired response function.

The basic procedure is illustrated in the above figure, taken from the manual; it's with this figure that I really understood the procedure best. What we need is the source image's [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function), or CDF, which is just a cumulative form of the image's histogram, normalized from 0 to 1. For every pixel value in the original image (1), we look up its value in the CDF (2), take this same value in the desired CDF function of your choice (3) (it could be a linear function, a [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), or whichever response function you choose), and backproject a new pixel value (4) in the same pixel location of a new image.

Here I attempt this procedure on a few sample images, many of them from travel photos I've taken over the past year. The above image was taken while waiting for a flight in Hong Kong International Airport (quite the story from that trip as well; we were delayed for almost an entire day for reasons due to the airline on what was only supposed to be a short layover in Hong Kong). In the photo, we can see that the light coming from the large atrium window outshines a lot of foreground details, in that they only appear to be silhouettes. Much of the architectural detail is also obscured by darkness.

Let's take a look at the original image's grayscale histogram and CDF:

We'll backproject using one of two functions and comparing results, the first being a simple linear function, and the second a logistic function which has a sigmoid shape:

Here are the resulting histograms of the image after backprojection:

We can compare this to the original histogram to find that the histogram values have been stretched out just so the cumulative function would conform as much as possible to our desired CDF.

But what do the images look like?

**Logistic CDF**

So there really was a lot of detail lurking behind the shadows! Immediately we notice the architectural details of the airport ceiling. We also begin to notice several other details, such as the chairs along the bottom, the wall clock and TV to the right, and of the people directly in front.

Of course, we're not only limited to working in grayscale. We can convert the color space to normalized chromaticity coordinates ([as in the post on image segmentation](http://devential.ml/2016/10/21/AP186-A7/)), apply the backprojection on the intensity image \\(I\\), which results in a new intensity image \\(I'\\) and recreate the new red, green and blue channels from \\(r\\), \\(g\\) and \\(b\\):

$$
R' = rI'\\
G' = gI'\\
B' = bI'
$$

Which gives us colored images with our new CDFs:

**Logistic CDF**

Here, we've recreated the image whilst preserving the colors, including the blue glow of the TV and the white shirt of the man in front.

Of course, there's one burning question: why are these images so grainy? Let's segue a little bit into JPEG compression.

## On JPEG compression

[JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) is one of the most common image file formats in use today. Part of its wide adoption is its support across many imaging and computer systems, as well as its native compression; which saves massive amounts of disk space compared to non-compressing formats that would save your image bit-by-bit.

JPEG is also lossy, in that information is lost through compression, but it's not just any information that's lost, however: the compression standard is simply another form and application of the [Fourier transformation and filtering](http://devential.ml/2016/10/13/AP186-A6/), where the image is transformed into the frequency domain, and a certain amount of high-frequency information is discarded, depending on the programmed quality. These high-frequency parts correspond to fine details in intensity and hue as we know by the anamorphic property of the Fourier transform.

JPEG also compresses much more in chromaticity or the variations in color than the luminance or intensity, as slight color differences are much less perceptible to human vision than slight intensity changes. By 'stretching' the histogram, we only make these compression artifacts ore evident, and even more so by adding in color information.

It would be possible that fewer compression artifacts would be seen if we had used a lossless format such as RAW instead of JPEG, as any artifacts then will likely be due to the encoding: images are popularly saved with their intensities in discrete 8-bit values. Higher-bit images may also be used, but their use is limited to more specialized applications.

Don't trust your eyes, indeed.

As a bonus, I've uploaded some of the other photos where I applied histogram manipulation to a public album on Google Photos.
