title: An Arch Linux/OS X Dual-boot Set Up
tags: linux

In the spirit of proper documentation, I’ve decided to document the entire process of installing Arch Linux in a dual boot setup with OS X on my MacBook Pro. Macs are notably finicky when installing _foreign_ operating systems such as many Linux distributions that aren’t Ubuntu, thus, keeping a proper log on what worked for me would be useful if ever I revisit this situation in the future. The install procedures I use here have been consolidated from many online sources which I’ve picked out through trial-and-error. Links to these references are noted in the appropriate parts. This also should serve as a good consolidated reference for anyone who decides to undertake a similar exercise. 

The installation proper was done on the 30th of August, 2014, with preparation of the installation media done days prior. The latest install image (`archlinux-2014.08.01-dual`) at this time was used; the currently available installation media will have changed at this point.

I am currently in the process of setting up my Arch installation. I'll update this page eventually.
