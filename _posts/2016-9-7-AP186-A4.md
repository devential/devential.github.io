title: Length and Area Estimation (AP186 A4)
tags: AP186
---  

Area may be estimated from an image for various applications such as the measurement of cells in an image of a microscope slide, or in determining lot areas of cadastral maps. Many methods and tools exist that allow for the measurement and scaling of lengths and areas, and this post delves into a short exploration of some of these available methods.

One method of the estimation of area in an image is by application of Green's theorem. [Green's theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreensTheorem.html), of course, relates the line integral around a closed curve with the surface integral of the enclosed area. The area \\( A \\) in particular can be computed with the following formula derived from Green's theorem:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2} \oint_C x dy - y dx. $$

The discrete form of this is useful in computational applications, as this allows us to estimate the area given discrete points along a contour. Here, a summation takes the place of the integral:

$$ A = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}). $$

An implementation of this discrete formula was done in Scilab. Synthetic images of regular shapes such as a circle, a triangle, and a square were created with known areas, each of size 500 Ã— 500. The contour of these images is defined by the edges of each shape, which may be found using edge detection methods. The `edge()` function in SIVP was used, making use of the Canny edge detection method as this provided a single-pixel edge for all test images unlike the other available edge detection methods. The [SIVP documentation](http://sivp.sourceforge.net/func-list-0.5.0/edge.htm) provides further information on syntax and the different edge detection methods available.

The table below compares the area estimation with actual area values, which were found by counting the number of white pixels in the image. Percent errors were small for both the Square and Circle shapes; however, the error was much larger for the Triangle.

Synthetic Image	| Actual Area (pixels)	| Computed Area (pixels)	| Percent error
Triangle 		| 69552					| 69344						| 3.000 %
Circle			| 101984				| 101981					| 0.002	%
Square			| 90000					| 89997						| 0.003 %

This was also applied to estimate the area of a real-world point-of-interest using Google Maps.

Shown below is a screenshot of the Kagitingan Executive Golf Course, a golf course in Taguig city. the whole course is divided into two parts by a road: The western part contains the driving range and the first four holes, while the eastern part contains the remaining five holes as well as a parade ground for the Army.

To get the total area of the golf course, a screenshot of the area in Google Maps was first edited and outlined in a bitmap image similar to the synthetic images first part. Here, like in real life, we analyze the area of the eastern part, leaving us with a single bitmap image of irregular shape.

To get the actual area, Google Maps has a scalebar in the corner: in this case, we find that 59 pixels correspond to 50 meters in real distance. This results in an real-world area of 79852.12 square meters.

For verification, the lot area was also measured using the 'measure' tool in Google Maps: 76034.43
m\\(^2\\). The percent error in terms of actual area is at 5 %, corresponding to a difference of 3817.69 m\\(^2\\), which, while small compared to the whole lot size, is still large in that it can easily cover the area of a small building.

 Computed Area (pixels)	| Computed Area (sqm)	| Actual Area | Percent error
94225.5 | 		79852.12	| 	76034.43	| 5.021 %

Next, we use more commonly-used software in finding the area of scanned physical objects. ImageJ is developed under the National Institutes of Helath originally for use in biological imaging, but has found its way towards many applications in the sciences.

Here, we use ImageJ to estimate lengths and areas of a subway card. Using the straight line tool, we can find the number of pixels that run across a line of known real-world length, and use this value by ratio and proportion to be able to estimate other lengths and areas.

The length of the card was measured to be 9.5 cm. With the straight line tool, this length was faund to cover a length of 665 pixels in the scan. This translates to a scale of 70 pixels/cm, according to the "set scale" tool.

Knowing this scale, we can begin to estimate areas of different portions of the card. The station 'bubbles,' for instance, are found to be 0.016 cm\\(^2\\) in area. The punched holes, meanwhile, are measured to be 0.098 cm in diameter.

For this activity, I would rate myself a **9/10** for following each step outlined and generating all required output. However, I feel like more could have been done especially in the improvement of the area estimation algorithm.

Aside from the linked sources above, I would also like to acknowledge the AP186 blog of [Kirby Cheng](http://kirbycheng.blogspot.com/2011/06/installing-scilab-412-sip-toolbox-on.html) for help in installing SIVP on OSX. In this case, I was able to install SIVP via the `atoms` command on Scilab 5.
