---  

Following segmentation and binarization to get your region of interest, another possible step may be to refine your ROI to a smoother and more solid blob. This may be done through mathematical morphology which is very much rooted in set theory.

A morphological operation is akin to an observer of a certain shape, where the observer filters out certain spatial elements of the shape when focusing on one particular spatial feature of it (Pitas, 1993). The morphological operation mimics this interaction using a simple shape called a *structuring element*, and using it to transform the target shape in order to enhance or diminish certain features, allowing the observer to obtain better information on the target object in question.

In this post, I will simply try to explain the basic operators used in many image processing applications and how they work. Further digression on the topic may be found in the reference (Pitas, 1993) that I cited, aside from several resources online that I linked below.

## The basics of morphological operations

There are two basic morphological operations in common use, *erosion* and *dilation*. Both of them are described in set notation as an operation between two sets of pixels: \\(A\\) as the binary image, and \\(B\\) as the structuring element with some defined origin (usually the center of the structuring element). There are also compound operations, which work as a combination of more basic functions.

### Erosion and dilation

Erosion is defined as *"the set of all points z such that B translated by z is contained in A"*:

$$
A \ominus B  = \{z | (B)_z\subseteq A\}
$$

In another sense, the eroded set is all pixel locations in your image for which you can place your structuring element from its origin and have the structuring element still be wholly contained in *A*. This, in a sense, erodes away parts that cannot fit in your structuring element, hence the name. Larger and more complex structuring elements can erode more and remove areas that jut out irregularly.

Dilation, on the other hand, is defined in set notation:

$$
A \oplus B  = \{z | (\hat{B})_z\cap A\neq 0\}
$$

which is all points *z* such that the reflection of *B* translated by *z* when intersected with *A* is not the empty set. This means that as long as any part of your structuring element intersects with your binary image *A*, the point under the structuring element's origin is considered part of the dilated set. This, in turn, dilates the image to beyond the original dimensions, depending on the structuring element.

This isn't the easiest to understand through just text, so we'll quickly show the effects of different binary figures when dilated or eroded with different structuring elements. The structuring elements used are in the figure above, where we'll label them *a* to *e*, while the dots denote the origin pixel, the reference point from which the structuring element will be translated. I first attempt to implement erosion and dilation on paper, and check my results with synthetic images to see whether I got it right the first time. Let's see how I did:

**Square**

![square.png](https://s11.postimg.cc/3k8ri9sur/square.png)

To introduce convention, the upper left image will be the original binary image, which in this case is a square with a side of five pixels. The first two rows will be my attempt at creating the eroded and dilated images given structuring elements *a* to *e*, where the lighter outlines are the original image boundaries. The lower two rows will be the same done on synthetic images and using the `imerode()` and `imdilate()` functions on MATLAB.

A lot of how the resulting images will look is dependent on the origin of your structuring element. *a* for instance has its origin in the upper left corner, with the rest of the pixels running along its right to lower sides. We can see that it seems to *project* its underlying structure on the original binary image in a sense. The dilation for instance removes all pixels from the bottommost row and rightmost column.

*b* and *c* could be called *subsets* of structuring element *a*, as they only run two pixels in a row, the difference being their orientations. As such, *b*, which has a single pixel to the right of its origin, removes or adds the rightmost column, while *c*, with a single pixel below the origin, removes or adds the row at the very bottom, in the case of erosion and dilation respectively.

We can also look at *e* which has a single pixel diagonal to the origin point. we see that the resulting image is akin to the union of the original image and the same image shifted downward and to the right by a single pixel each. *d* on the other hand seems to add rows and columns in all directions except for the very corners.

**Triangle**

![tri.png](https://s16.postimg.cc/gyzb5gst1/tri.png)

We define a triangle for a base of four pixels and a height of three pixels (not exactly the nicest looking triangle up close, but still good enough.) It's much of the same interactions as with the square from earlier for many of the structuring elements. One part of note is the erosion with structuring element *d*, which returns the empty set since there is no pixel in the original binary image where the structuring element can fit in wholly.

**Box**

![box.png](https://s13.postimg.cc/dfnh9gffr/box.png)

Defined here is a hollow box with sides of width 2 pixels and a length of 10 pixels. Here, I note a small error in my attempt at erosion with structuring element *e*. Compared to the synthetic result, I had failed to include the bumps on the inside of the loop, which are supposed to be within the set as the structuring element still falls within the original images at these points.

**Cross**

![cross.png](https://s14.postimg.cc/rmglefd9d/cross.png)

Defined is a cross with a diameter of five pixels. The erosion with *a* is an empty set because *a* cannot fit in anywhere in the original binary image. The results of dilation for structuring elements *d* and *e* produce some pretty interesting patterns!

### Compound operations

![fork.png](https://s16.postimg.cc/xn3j4xsw5/fork.png)

Two compound morphological operations are the close and open operations. Closing is just a dilation followed by erosion with the same structuring element, which tends to fill in small gaps in the original image. Opening on the other hand, is erosion followed by dilation, and this removes any external 'nubs' in the original image. One characteristic of these operators are that they would tend to preserve the global dimension of your image, and are often used to plug in any discontinuities in the ROI blobs.

## Cells and blobs

![Circles002.jpg](https://s12.postimg.cc/uc5nmzep9/Circles002.jpg)

As a short application, we aim to gather the average area and dimensions all objects in the above 'cell' image (which are really [chads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_%28paper%29) from a paper punch) above. One real world application is on the counting of cells in microscope images: a task that is extremely tedious when done manually. I've actually had some experience counting cells by hand back in high school: we were tasked to determine the number of algae cells in an algal bloom sample, and were given a special slide that allowed you to overlay a physical grid on your cells, and we would spend hours counting the number of cells that fall within each square of the grid. It's pure tedium at best, and often leaves you wishing for a better method; years later, here I am, attempting one such alternate method through image processing.

To begin, we first take subimages of the original image so as not to tax our system too much, and binarizing them. Shown below is the binarized upper-right hand subimage:

![c1binor215.png](https://s14.postimg.cc/4y740fn9t/c1binor215.png)

A quick look at this binary image shows that the segmented blobs are not perfect circles: indeed, there are some areas that are not completely filled in, and several overlapping cells that need to be separated. To be able to segment these blobs, we use a combination of the morphological operations discussed above, with different structuring elements, tweaked to get the best representation of the ROI out of our image.

![c1rawbin.png](https://s12.postimg.cc/sb9xcl4v1/c1rawbin.png)

This now cleaned image used the following combination of operators in order:

1. Close with structuring element `disk` of radius 3
2. Open with structuring element `disk` of radius 9
3. Close with structuring element `disk` of radius 4
4. Open with structuring element `disk` of radius 9

The `disk` structuring element was chosen to preserve the roundness of the blobs. Although many of the blobs appear separated, there are a lot of compound blobs due to the overlaps, which will greatly skew properties such as area and the number of cells. Shown here are each of the blobs with circles of the average diameter of all blobs, overlaid on their centroids:

![c1 circlevis.png](https://s12.postimg.cc/bsfubg8ct/c1_circlevis.png)

 We add one more step to be able to segment the still strongly overlapping cells:

 ![celllabel.png](https://s13.postimg.cc/6031u92yf/celllabel.png)

Here we used a watershed segmentation function to segment the large cell clusters, so that they are counted as smaller individual cells rather than one large contiguous blob. WE see this fail, however, in the large contiguous blob, but it successfully segments the smaller blobs with a lower amount of overlap. This also helps in keeping the variance in cell areas low, as we will use the average areas here as a threshold to detect cancer cells, the abnormally large ones, in another image:

![Circles with cancer.jpg](https://s15.postimg.cc/j6ercezej/Circles_with_cancer.jpg)

From the original cell image, we were able to derive a mean blob area of 378.45 pixels. We can simply perform the same segmentation on this new image:

![ccan1.png](https://s18.postimg.cc/atsg7x4d5/ccan1.png)

... and count and mark all the cells that fall above this value plus the standard deviation:

![ccanlarge.png](https://s16.postimg.cc/dhijubp39/ccanlarge.png)

Where we estimate there to be 9 cancer cells in the image.

For getting all of the output and graphics, I give myself a self evaluation score of **10/10**. References are all linked below.
