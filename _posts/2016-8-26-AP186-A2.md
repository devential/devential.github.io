title: Digital Scanning (AP186 A2)
tags: AP186
---  

Prior to the advent of computer-generated charts and graphs, many forms of data visualization were once completely drawn and drafted by hand, needing a meticulous eye and care to avoid mistakes that may misrepresent the results being presented. We take on this accuracy from before by scanning through old reputable journals and attempting to digitize one such hand-drawn plot, simply by interpolating from pixel points on a simple scan of the graph to find their respective graph coordinates.

Here I dug through some dusty old journals in the CS library and found a paper entitled "The Effect of Humidity on the Velocity of Sound in Air" by W.R. Barss and J.E. Bastille (1923, doi: 10.1002/sapm192321210). The paper came with two figures, one of them being a handwritten plot of the theoretical and experimental velocities of sound in air against percent saturation, or the air's humidity. Accompanying the plots are tables of actual experimental and theoretical values, which would definitely aid in verifying these values.

The page was first photocopied, then the photocopy scanned using a flatbed scanner at 100dpi. The resulting scan was then edited to correct for rotations and cropped to a single 436 × 432 image seen below.

First, some observations: we see that there are two plots on the graph, with points marked as crosses and circles. In the paper, they are labeled curves XX and curves 00, which refer to the experimental values as well as their theoretical consideration, respectively. Just for the sake of information, the theoretical relation plotted as curve 00 in the paper is,

$$ V_m = V_a \sqrt{\frac{ D_a }{D_m}}, $$

where \\( V \\) is the velocity of sound, and \\( D \\) is the density. The subscripts \\( a \\) and \\( m \\) refer to dry air and moist air, respectively. The speed of sound in dry air, of course, is given through the relation,

$$ V = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma E}{D}}, $$

\\( \gamma \\) being the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure against that at constant volume, and \\( E \\) being the isothermal bulk modulus.

To be able to create a digital version of this graph, we have to be able to translate the pixel coordinates of each graph point in the image to their respective graph coordinates. We note the value of the origin at pixel coordinates `(62, 342)`. It is also known that the final points on both graphs correspond to 100% saturation of the air. Both final points were seen to have pixel coordinates with their x-values at 387. dividing the number of pixels that run along the x-axis of the graph by 10 (10 being the number of ticks along the x-axis), we find that each tick, an increase of 10 percent saturation in the graph, corresponds to 32.5 pixels on the image. Similarly, we find that each tick in the y-axis corresponds to 82 pixels on the image.

Knowing these relations, we can interpolate from pixel to graph coordinates. Let \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) be the graph origin coordinates, \\( i_0 \\) and \\( j_0 \\) be the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) at the origin point, \\( T_x \\) and \\( T_y \\) be the tick pixel length, and \\( t_i \\) and \\( t_j \\) be the tick interval of the graph. The graph coordinates \\( (i,j) \\) of given pixel coordinates \\( (x,y) \\) are found through the equations:

$$ i = i_0 + \frac{t_i(x-x_0)}{T_x} $$

$$ j = j_0 + \frac{t_j(y_0-y)}{T_y} $$

Note that for \\( j \\), \\( y \\) is subtracted from \\( y_0 \\) due to the fact that the pixel origin of an image is found at the upper-left hand corner of the image, while that of the graph is at its lower-left hand corner. In the case of this graph, \\( (x_0, y_0) = (62, 342) \\), \\( (i_0, j_0) = (10, 0) \\), \\( (T_x, T_y) = (32.5, 82) \\), and \\( (t_i, t_j) = (0, 1127) \\).

The pixel values of each XX and 00 graph point were noted, and their corresponding graph coordinates were then computed. Using these values, a plot was created, and is displayed below.

On verifying computed graph values with the actual tabulated values in the paper, it was seen that the y-values of humidity for both the XX and 00 curves all fell within an error of \\( \pm 0.01 \\). There is some discrepancy with the x-values of the theoretical plot at 60 percent saturation, which is off in the computed value at 58.46, which isn't too far off and can easily be corrected, as it is known that the x-values of the theoretical should all fall cleanly on the tick marks. Overall, the above reconstruction could be rated a **9/10**. As for a personal rating, I would give myself a **10/10** for being able to finish each required point.
