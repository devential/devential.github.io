title: Maze generation using cellular automata
tags: P305
---

I remember an early AP155 project where we implemented [Wilson's algorithm](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11357811) which generates a maze using a loop-erased random walk. Seeing a project for Physics 305 involving the investigation of a CA algorithm made me wonder whether maze generation was possible using a cellular automata method. 

Conway's 'Game of Life' is a classic cellular automata model that takes place on a square lattice with each cell having two states: either dead or alive. The life and death of each cell in the lattice depends on the number of neighbors: an initially dead cell with at least three neighbors (in a Moore neighborhood) births a living cell in that location in the next generation, any live cell is sustained to the next generation if it has either two or three neighbors, and any cell with less than two or more than three neighbors will die of either starvation or overpopulation. Modifications to the original life algorithm have been proposed that either change the lattice, the neighborhood considered, or the conditions for birth, survival, and death of a cell. A modification to the original rules of Life have been termed 'life-like' cellular automata. 

One such life-like is the 'Maze' CA[^1], with rulestring `B3/S12345`; that is, a cell is birthed if it has three neighbors, and survives for any number of neighbors from one to five. The results of this CA are interesting in that most initial configurations will grow explosively, forming maze-like patterns in its wake. The large range in the number of neighbors needed for survival make it harder for cells to die off, and in a finite lattice, it will eventually lead to a large maze-like still life, if not a low-period oscillator. The original author of the life-like is unknown[^2]. 

An alternative rulestring is 'Mazectric,' whose rulestring (`B3/S1234`) omits survival at 5 neighbors. Originally authored and investigated by Charles A. Rockafellor[^2], it is described to produce longer halls and more linear paths than Maze. In this blog, I implement both Maze and Mazectric and compare the generated mazes of each one.

My implementation was done for a \\(50\times 50\\) unit square lattice with nonperiodic boundary conditions, where cells beyond the edges of the system are treated as dead/zero when considering the neighbors of any edge cells. a \\(10\times 10\\) region in the center of the lattice is then randomly populated with living cells to form the initial state of the CA. The lattice is then iterated following the provided ruleset until a still life or period-2 oscillator state is reached for the entire lattice. I have not encountered any oscillators with a period higher than two in any of my runs, and they do seem rare. [The code for my implementation is available here.](https://gist.github.com/devential/d666d82e22fcd1137a853b3370b50446)

For the initial state shown in (a), the resulting final states of Maze and Mazectric are shown in (b) and (c) respectively. Both CAs required a similar number of generations to reach stability: Maze became stable in the lattice in 96 generations, while Mazectric became a period-two oscillator in 102 generations. The large range of neighbors that ensures survival of a cell in Maze also leads to immediate stability when within the growing walls of the maze, unlike Mazectric which still 'settles' for a few generations within the walls, before establishing themselves into longer, uniform halls. These observations are evident in the animations of the evolution of both CAs shown below. One other difference (which I've also observed for other random initial states not shown here) is that Mazectric tends to fill out the entire lattice more often than Maze, which may also be due to Maze's stability within the growing walls leaving stable pockets where no new cells could be birthed inside.

Both of these CAs have been described as generating maze-like patterns which aren't necessarily solveable. For a maze with a single solution, other methods of maze generation may be preferable. However, the very evolution of stable maze-like patterns just by specifying a rulestring is an interesting phenomenon in itself.
