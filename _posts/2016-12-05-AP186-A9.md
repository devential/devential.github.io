title: Playing notes through image processing (AP186 A9)
tags: AP186
---  

As a culmination of image processing techniques employing morphological operations, we continue towards using image processing to be able to "play" a musical sheet. Here we use a [musical sheet downloaded from the internet](http://www.jazclass.aust.com/articles/autsoc.gif) (source image linked) of the famous jazz standard Autumn Leaves, of which there have been [several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Z8KuwI7Gc) [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxqzKIHx5Y4) [recordings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jiXQmWBXbY) by jazz artists. [This recording by Ryo Fukui](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpYibfCLYWU) is a personal favorite of mine.

Allow me to make a short segue: the musical sheet that I took appears to be one taken from a [fake book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book), albeit recreated digitally in this case, which are traditionally just loose sheets of musical scores photocopied cheaply and distributed among musicians to help them learn tunes as quickly as possible prior to a performance. Here the lead sheets are characterized by having just a simple melody in a certain key and chords. The genius of the interpretations I linked above come in through improvization by the artists over the same basic melody, which ultimately leads to a whole slew of several different versions and many fresh takes of what is practically the same song.

Now, on to implementing a way of reading this sheet. Most, if not all popular programming languages have some utility or function that allows for simple tones to be played through the PC speaker or sound card. In MATLAB, the `sound()` function can send any audio signal (sinusoid, square wave, or any complex combination of such to create more interesting notes) to the sound card to play.

To aid in creating audio signals to play notes, we define a function `note()` that returns a signal for a given frequency and duration:

```matlab
function n = note(f,t)
    n = sin(2*pi*f*linspace(0,t,8192*t));
end
```

Using this function, we can utilize the standard frequencies in the western musical scale. As an example, we can play a note by passing the command `sound(note(261.63, 1))` which plays the note C4 (261.63 Hz) for a duration of one second.

To simplify the scope of what needs to be done, we first limit ourselves to a crop of the very first staff, containing the first three measures of the song as well as a trailing note from the fourth. This limits us to only two types of notes to work with: whole notes and quarter notes. So as not to complicate things, we ignore any ties and dotted notes for now.

The primary difference between whole notes and quarter notes are in whether the circle locating the note is filled in or not. Using a set of morphological operators on the staff image, we can end up with large blobs for the quarter notes and two small dots for the whole notes:

![notebin.png](https://s11.postimg.cc/u38tvzbsz/notebin.png)

The operators used here are first to open with a `rectangle` structuring element of dimensions `[3, 1]` and then to erode with a `disk` structuring element, radius 1, to only preserve the note blobs. The first problem that needs to be addressed is to determine where the blobs would appear in relation to the staff, as this determines the very value of the note. Here we apply a morphological operator with a structuring element that results in only the staff remaining on the image:

![staffbin.png](https://s18.postimg.cc/6uscuij3t/staffbin.png)

 Here the opening operator was used for a `rectangle` structuring element of dimensions `[1, 70]`. As the staff consists of a reasonably straight horizontal line of a single pixel in width, we can simply get the pixel heights that each staff line falls on, and divide the notes following that staff line. To determine the note denoted by the blob, we take the blob's centroid height and compare it with the staff line locations as to whether it falls on a staff line, between a staff line, or above the staff line. Note that we do not need to worry about the order of the notes here, as the order of centroid locations in `regionprops()` is from the leftmost blob to the rightmost, which is the standard direction of reading notes.

We can map notes for the given scale to values of staff pixel heights. For this sheet, the key is denoted by the number of sharps or flats beside the clef: in the full sheet, we see a single sharp on the staff, which gives us a key of G, and any notes that fall on F on the staff will be sharped. All that needs to be done after is to append every blob in the order that they appear from left to right in the image to a list, which will then be read by the note function to get the proper frequencies and tone lengths. Here we note that the whole note manifests as two very small blobs close together; in this case we remove the later small blob and use the centroid location of the former as basis for the note height. All that needs to be done now is to append each waveform to some array and pass it to `sound()`, where it will play each note in the order specified.

Below is the final code that plays the given staff line image (saved as "linetest.jpg"), making use of the `note()` function defined above:

```matlab
% Define notes
B3 = 246.94;
C4 = 261.63;
D4 = 293.66;
E4 = 329.63;
F4 = 349.23;
Fs4 = 369.99;
G4 = 392.00;
A4 = 440.00;
B4 = 493.88;
C5 = 523.25;
D5 = 587.33;
E5 = 659.25;
Fs5 = 739.99;
G5 = 783.99;
rest = 0;

% Define note lengths
note1 = 2;      % Whole note
note2 = 1;      % Half note
note4 = 0.5;    % Quarter note
note8 = 0.25;   % Eighth note

% Find staff line locations
I = imread('linetest.jpg');
Ibin = im2bw(I, 215/256);
Ibin = imcomplement(Ibin);
%imshow(Ibin);
staff = imopen(Ibin, strel('rectangle',[1, 70]));
snotes = imerode(imopen(Ibin, strel('rectangle',[3,1])), strel('disk', 1));
imshow(snotes);

staffpos = find(staff(:,1) == 1);

% Find centroids of note blobs
% If blobs are close to each other (< width of note blob), make whole note

stats = regionprops('table',snotes,'Centroid','MajorAxisLength','Area');
notewidth = mean(stats.MajorAxisLength) + 2;
notearea = mean(stats.Area);
playstats = stats;
playstats(find(diff(stats.Centroid(:,1))<notewidth),:) = [];

% Measure notes and rests in relation to staff and translate
notethresh = mean(diff(staffpos))/2;
home = staffpos(1)-(notethresh/2);
spacing = home:notethresh:home + notethresh*12;
% notevals start with G5; key signature specifies F sharp
% noteval must equal spacing
noteval = [G5, Fs5, E5, D5, C5, B4, A4, G4, Fs4, E4, D4, C4, B3];
notedur = [note1, note4];
playarr = [];

for i = 1:height(playstats)
    for j = 1:length(spacing)
        if playstats.Centroid(i,2) < spacing(j)
            if playstats.Area(i) < notearea
                durindex = 1;
            else
                durindex = 2;
            end
            playarr = horzcat(playarr,[note(noteval(j), notedur(durindex))]);
            break
        end
    end
end

sound(playarr)
```

Running this would immediately play the first three measures of a now familiar tune (if you had either heard the song before or given some of the versions I linked above a listen). This code should work for any set of notes and measures that consist of just whole and quarter notes in this sheet, and would only need minor modifications to the keys if one were to use some other sheet.

While I've created code that can play a line of a staff, it is still fairly basic, and I decided not to extend it to play notes of different lengths or include sharps or flats for now. For this, I give myself a self evaluation score of **9/10**.
