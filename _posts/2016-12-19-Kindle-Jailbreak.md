title: Jailbreaking the Kindle
tags: kindle

As a little treat to myself, I bought an old Amazon Kindle Paperwhite to help me burn through my book backlog over the December break. Just days later, I find myself today installing Python on the device; not a sight you would see every day.

Here, Python was a required dependency for a few extensions that allow me to customize [fonts](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=219405) and [screensavers](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=195474), and I installed it just minutes after going through the motions of jailbreaking.

On hearing that [a jailbreak was very much possible on the Kindle](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=275881) (and on multiple hardware versions at that), I took the opportunity to try it out myself. The [MobileRead](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=180113) forums were an excellent resource for jailbreaking and extensions, and the entire process was considerably more painless than I had originally thought, thanks to the work of volunteer developers making things as user-friendly as possible.

The rationale for jailbreaking the Kindle for me wasn't to override Amazon's walled garden to allow me to suppress ads or sideload books; on the contrary, a non-jailbroken device can just as easily sideload ebooks labeled as personal documents, while bypassing Amazon's ads were [frowned upon in the forums](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=200942) if you had not paid the fee to remove ads on discounted devices (if you aren't familiar, [Amazon sells discounted versions of their e-readers,](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200671290) with a caveat that they come bundled with what they term *special offers*, or simply, ads, that display when you put your device to sleep but otherwise don't intrude during reading). For me, the fact that it opened up extensibility of the features of my device, and that the last official firmware update for the PW1 is already a few versions behind the current version, with no plan for future updates, gives me nothing much to lose with so much more to gain.

Beyond using extensions developed by others, I plan to toy around with the system and try to run along with my own extensions. I'm personally excited to see where this goes.
