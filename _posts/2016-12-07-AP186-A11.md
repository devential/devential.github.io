title: Basic video processing (AP186 A11)
tags: AP186
---  

A video, in its simplest form, is just a sequence of images flashed fast enough to manifest the perception of motion. It's the basic form of several means of electronic entertainment we have today.

Like images, we can also 'process' video for several applications by simply processing each and every frame as its own individual image. This also provides us with a time dimension with which to analyze our images, making things like kinematic measurement possible.

As an example, let's attempt to measure acceleration due to gravity from a video of a tennis ball dropped from a height:

From the video file, relevant frames can easily be extracted as images. Using ffmpeg, [it's a one-line affair in the command line](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Create%20a%20thumbnail%20image%20every%20X%20seconds%20of%20the%20video):

```
ffmpeg -i /Path/to/video/file.mp4 -vf fps=29.659852 out%03d.png
```

Here the `fps` value is specified as the number of frames per second, as given in the video metadata. This line will write an image file for every video frame to the working directory. For our purposes, we will only use a subset of the images in the video, particularly the set that falls between the 50 and 150 cm marks on the wall: a total of 11 frames have the ball visible near, along, or in front of this one-meter length.

For one of these images, we use basic image processing techniques as described in previous blog posts; here, from a patch image of the ball, we backproject its rg histogram values onto the frame image akin to the [post on image segmentation](http://devential.ml/2016/10/21/AP186-A7/). Note that to greatly reduce computation time and count out the need to filter out background noise, it is best to only use a small section cropped but can still contain the ROIs of every image.

Here, by applying a threshold of 0.5 to the backprojected image, we get a fairly contiguous blob. To get the ball's location from this blob, we simply find the centroid coordinates and note this value for later computation.

The 'video processing' step comes with getting the blobs and computing the centroids for each image:

Where, by now, we have the centroid information for each frame:

```
Centroid    
________________

72.933    26.076
73.142    76.302
75.974    145.11
76.965    222.24
80.372    304.67
84.116    399.87
87.826    499.97
91.628    607.67
94.858    720.63
96.421    840.51
```

Here we see that the centroid values for the *y* axis are increasing, as it should be. Once we have the centroids, it's all a matter of using simple kinematic equations to get the instantaneous velocity and acceleration between frames.

Of course, prior to this, we have to convert our pixel unit distance to meters, and our frames-per-second to a \\(\Delta t\\) in seconds. Getting time is easy, it's just the reciprocal of the FPS value (or \\(1/29.659852\\)). For the video, on the other hand, it's a return to using ratio and proportion: a 1 m distance on the video is 792 pixels long, which gives us a meter per pixel value of \\(1/792\\).

Now knowing these values, we can compute the real-world distance between centroids in two frames, and this becomes our \\(\Delta d\\). our instantaneous velocity given two subsequent frames is:

$$
v = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}
$$

with the resulting data shown below.

```

2.5789                
2.8887                
3.0898                
3.5679                
 3.751                
4.0361                
4.2318                
4.4899                
```

Notice how the value appears to increase linearly, in the latter frames, generally a good sign. Finally, we obtain the instantaneous acceleration. This is derived from two subsequent velocities \\(v_0\\) and \\(v_f\\):

$$
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t}
$$

Which would return acceleration values:

```

14.179                    
5.4324                    
8.4551                    
5.8053                    
7.6552                    
```

Although they do vary a little wildly, it may be best to take the mean of these instantaneous accelerations, which would give us a value of 9.6727 m/s\\(^2\\). We know that the acceleration due to gravity falls around 9.8 m/s\\(^2\\), so our computed mean acceleration verifies this value fairly accurately. Not bad for only 11 usable frames!

My self-evaluation for this report is *10/10*.
