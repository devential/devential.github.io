title: More on the Fourier Transform (AP186 A6)
tags: AP186
---  

In this post, we investigate more properties of the 2D Fourier transform, picking up from the [last post](http://devential.ml/2016/10/11/AP186-A5/). Let's dive right in!

## The anamorphic property

This was touched on only briefly in the last post, so here I'll discuss a little further. The anamorphism of the Fourier transform refers to the behavior of features when transformed from spatial dimensions to frequency dimensions (or vice versa), where originally wide features become narrow and narrow features end up wide. We've noticed previously that transforming large apertures results in small-diametered Airy patterns, while a tiny aperture can create a fairly wide Airy pattern.

We illustrate this with a rectangular aperture, oriented that it can be considered either tall or wide. Here we can see that extending the aperture along one axis results in the FT being smaller about that same axis, while minimizing it about another axis stretched the resulting FT.

We then look at two dots of one-pixel diameter symmetric about the center. From our previous encounters with this pattern, we know that this will manifest as a sinusoid along the same axis in the Fourier transform. If we were to vary the distance of the dots from the center, we see that increasing the distance between the dots increases the frequency of the sinusoid in the Fourier transform, while bringing the dots closer to the center lowers the frequency. Hence, the positions of the dots themselves correspond to the frequency of the resulting sinusoid in the Fourier transform!

## The rotation property

The Fourier transform also has some properties with regard to rotation and orientation. Once again, we work with dots and sinusoids, this time beginning with a sinusoid along one axis. Taking its Fourier transform results in two dots along the same axis the sinusoid runs along. Analogous to the previous part, these dots correspond to the frequency of the sinusoid, measured from the center.

To show this, we vary the frequency of the input sinusoid over several different values. We can see that at low frequencies, the dots appear closer to the center, and increasing the frequencies results in the dots moving farther apart.

Superimposing a vertical and horizontal sinusoid will still show FT peaks along the vertical and horizontal axes, which means that the Fourier transform is pretty robust in detecting repeated patterns.

Now, what if we were to begin rotating these sinusoids? If you take the Fourier transform of a rotated sinusoid, you would find that the resulting dots still follow the orientation of the sinusoid.

If we were to combine superimposed sinusoids and rotation, we would ideally expect multiple peaks corresponding to just the combinations used. However, the result above, which is a combination of a vertical sinusoid, a sinusoid rotated by 30 degrees, and another by 40 degrees, shows more than six peaks. Here the image is also dominated by frequencies brought about by aliasing resulting from a combination of different sinusoids at different angles.

One limitation of using images to represent functions is that images cannot display negative values. If we were to directly use an image of a sinusoid taking note of each pixel's intensity value, it would simply appear as if the image has an applied DC bias.

In Fourier space, we can see this DC offset represented by a point of zero or near-zero frequency; essentially a white dot in the center of the FT. To remove this offset, we can simply filter out the DC component through *masking*.

## Convolution

Before delving into masking and filtering techniques head on, we first take another look at the convolution theorem.

![5conv1.png](https://s4.postimg.cc/ces5p8a99/5conv1.png)

For two one-pixel wide dots, we note a sinusoidal pattern in the resulting FT. Increasing the diameter of the dots so that they appear as small circles shows us what looks like an airy pattern, with a sinusoidal pattern superimposed. We know from the previous part that the sinusoidal pattern manifests in the FT of two symmetric dots, while the Airy pattern manifests from the FT of an aperture. A combined Airy pattern and sinusoid is a convolution of the aperture and the dots symmetric about the center.

![5conv2.png](https://s16.postimg.cc/rkqso39np/5conv2.png)

Replacing the small circles with squares, we see a similar effect, but instead of an Airy pattern, the FT pattern of the square aperture is shown.

![5conv3.png](https://s10.postimg.cc/faj3tses9/5conv3.png)

If we were to replace the dots with 2D Gaussians, we see that the resulting Fourier transform shows a single 2D Gaussian convolved with a sinusoidal pattern.

## Filtering and enhancement in Fourier space

As features in Fourier space describe certain elements in the spatial realm, we can exploit this to be able to filter out elements that exhibit periodicity in image space, as periodic elements tend to appear as strong features in the Fourier transform. Likewise, we can also choose to isolate or enhance these elements by enhancing their corresponding features in Fourier space.

The main procedure is simple:

1. Given an image with recurring features to be removed or enhanced, take its Fourier transform.
2. Study the Fourier transform to locate the peaks of your desired features, and create a mask that either isolates or suppresses those peaks.
3. Multiply the FT image with the mask and take its inverse transform, with all necessary rotations and shifts, to end up with your desired image.

Once I was able to write out the code for one part, it became a boilerplate for any image I wanted to either filter or enhance through masking in the Fourier domain; the main bulk of the work is in designing each mask, with quite a bit of trial and error in getting the mask just right.

![fpgallery.png](https://s9.postimg.cc/ri3c6yn3j/fpgallery.png)

First, an exercise in enhancement. We want to be able to enhance this scanned image of a fingerprint (a), preserving the ridges and filtering out unnecessary textures. Following the steps, and using a grayscale version of the scan (b), we have our Fourier transform image (c&zwnj;).

Recall from a previous part of this post, on the Rotation property of the Fourier transform, where rotated sinusoids of similar frequencies would manifest as points in a circle about the center. With alternating bands of peaks and troughs, we can easily say that a fingerprint very much resembles a sinusoid, oriented in many different directions but with a near-constant frequency, as the distance between fingerprint ridges is nearly the same. In the Fourier transform image (c&zwnj;), there is a very clear ring that peaks surrounding the center, so this ring could correspond to the fingerprint features. Filtering it out using a mask (d), noting that all white values will be kept, we now have an enhanced image of our fingerprint (e).

![origenhanced.png](https://s18.postimg.cc/xw3jiqp4p/origenhanced.png)

If we were to compare the original fingerprint image with the enhanced image, we can see that even gaps in the original image appear "filled in" in the enhanced version.

Next, an exercise in filtering. One good test image that can be improved with filtering are lunar surface photos from the Apollo missions, which have visible image seams due to the fact that these photos were built in strips taken one-by-one and combined to form a whole composite image. Here, our goal is to be able to filter out these seams for a better, seamless image.

From our given image (a), we first get its Fourier transform (b). Notice how the seams in the image (a) only appear horizontally, akin to a sinusoid running along the vertical axis. This should manifest as a set of peaks in the Fourier transform image, directly on the vertical axis. Noting this, we design a filter mask (c&zwnj;) that will mask the peaks of the FT's vertical axis, with a hole for the DC bias. Note that unlike our mask for the fingerprint enhancement, the white areas in this part will suppress the signals under them in the FT. The resulting image (d) now contains no lines, and is completely seamless. I've uploaded full resolution images for this part here: [original lunar image](https://postimg.cc/image/4wxhffa4b/), [processed lunar image](https://postimg.cc/image/m5oiiseod/).

Our final look at enhancement and filtering will involve both the removal and isolation of the canvas weave pattern of a painting. From our original image (a), we have its Fourier transform (b). As the canvas weave is fairly evident in the original image, and consists of a strong recurring pattern that appears to be the combination of multidirectional sinusoids of different frequencies, we expect the Fourier transform to exhibit strong peaks symmetric about the center that are caused by the canvas weave.

Our mask (c&zwnj;), when used for filtering, is able to remove much of the canvas weave pattern in the resulting image (d), allowing us to study the painting itself as well as the artist's brush strokes in finer detail.

We can also choose to isolate the canvas weave pattern by inverting the mask used. The following image shows the wave pattern in detail:

Again, the filtering is much more evident when seen in detail. Linked are full resolution versions of the original and resulting filtered and isolated images: original painting image, [canvas weave filtered](https://postimg.cc/image/t98f2wi3f/), and [canvas weave isolated](https://postimg.cc/image/c3t40auet/).

For completing most parts of what was required of this activity, I give myself a self-evaluation of **8/10**.

Once again, I would like to acknowledge Louie Rubio for his insight which helped me develop the filter masks of the filtering and enhancement part.
