title: My acceptance into IPL
---

Today I’ve been officially accepted as a member of the [Instrumentation Physics Laboratory](http://sites.google.com/site/instrumentationphysicslab/), under Dr. Maricor Soriano of the [Video and Image Processing subgroup](http://sites.google.com/site/instrumentationphysicslab/research/vip). The arduous month-long application process was well worth it, and now I’ve begun settling in as a member of the laboratory. Here’s to brighter things and newer experiences ahead.
