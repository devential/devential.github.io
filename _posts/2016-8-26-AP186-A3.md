---  

This isn't my first time working in Scilab, as I've had experience with it in the past years or so, all in the middle of that transitionary period in breaking away from being a stickler for a single programming language.

To begin, the following code block:

```java
t = [0:0.1:2];
y = sin(t);
plot(t,y)
````

generates this graph that displays part of a sine wave:

Going line-by-line, `t = [0:0.1:2];` creates a one-dimensional matrix with numbers from 0 to 2, equally spaced by 0.1 units. `y = sin(t);` computes the sine of each value in matrix `t` and stores it in matrix `y`.

Matrix operations in Scilab are as simple as they could get. Addition of two matrices of the same dimensions is done with `+`, matrix multiplication with `*`, and element-by-element multiplication with `.*`.

Element-by-element multiplication is also useful in generating synthetic images to be used as image masks. The following code block for instance creates a circular aperture:

![aperture](https://s9.postimg.org/eyhazzbxb/annulus.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
r = sqrt(X.^2 + Y.^2);
A = zeros(nx,ny);
A (find(r<0.7)) = 1;
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

The line ``r = sqrt(X.^2 + Y.^2);`` creates something akin to a cone in 3D space, while the line ``A (find(r<0.7)) = 1;`` "fills" values below 0.7 in the code with the value 1, corresponding to a white pixel in the final plot.

From this example, we were tasked to create several synthetic images:

### Centered square aperture
![square](https://s10.postimg.org/psw69l8eh/square.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
A = ones(nx, ny);
r = sqrt(X.^2);
A (find(r>0.5)) = 0;
r = sqrt(Y.^2);
A (find(r>0.5)) = 0;
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

This is a simple combination of slices that create "bars" along a given direction.

### Sinusoid along the x-direction

![sinusoid](https://s9.postimg.org/f3yko4c1r/sinusoid.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
A = zeros(nx, ny);
A = cos(20*X);
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

A sinusoidal function in one dimension was graphed.

### Grating along the x-direction

![grating](https://s22.postimg.org/uei6hpv1d/grating.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
A = zeros(nx, ny);
r = cos(20*X);
A (find(r>0.7)) = 1;
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

This is similar to the sinusoidal graph, but is "sliced" at a given value.

### Annulus

![annulus](https://s4.postimg.org/he4ksoqb1/annulus2.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
r = sqrt(X.^2 + Y.^2);
A = zeros(nx, ny);
A (find(r<0.7)) = 1;
A (find(r<0.5)) = 0;
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

### Circular aperture with Gaussian transparency

![gauss](https://s13.postimg.org/a71j3tbuf/gaussap.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
A =1 ./(0.5*sqrt(2*%pi))*exp(-(((X)/0.5).^2/2+((Y)/0.5).^2/2))
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

A 2D gaussian function was created and graphed in this code block.

### Ellipse

![ellipse](https://s21.postimg.org/sdg25mihj/ellipse.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
r = sqrt((X./1.3).^2 + Y.^2);
A = zeros(nx,ny);
A (find(r<0.7)) = 1;
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

### Cross

![cross](https://s11.postimg.org/qk95xobur/cross.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);
A = zeros(nx, ny);
r = sqrt(X.^2);
A (find(r<0.3)) = 1;
r = sqrt(Y.^2);
A (find(r<0.3)) = 1;
f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

### Moiré
Of course, more complex synthetic images can be generated from many combinations of functions. The following code block, for instance, superimposes two sets of concentric circles shifted a small distance from each other to exhibit a Moiré effect.

![moire](https://s14.postimg.org/rs7qgoxnl/moire.png)

```java
nx = 100;
ny = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,nx);
y = linspace(-1,1,ny);
[X,Y] = ndgrid(x,y);

A = ones(nx,ny);
r = sqrt((X+.1).^2 + Y.^2);
A (find(r>0.95)) = 0;
for i = flipdim(0.05:0.1:0.95, dim = 2)
    A (find(r<i)) = 1;
    A (find(r<(i-0.05))) = 0;
end

B = ones(nx,ny);
r = sqrt((X-.1).^2 + Y.^2);
B (find(r>0.95)) = 0;
for i = flipdim(0.05:0.1:0.95, dim = 2)
    B (find(r<i)) = 1;
    B (find(r<(i-0.05))) = 0;
end

f = scf()
grayplot(x,y,A+B);
f.color_map = graycolormap(32);
```

In all, I had no trouble completing this activity, due in part to my experience with Scilab and the fact that I had done a similar activity in GNU Octave about two years back. In this activity, I would rate myself a **10/10** for being able to successfully generate each synthetic image, as well as generating my own image.
