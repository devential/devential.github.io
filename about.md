You’ve reached the personal online pages of Micholo Medrana. I’m currently an undergraduate of the University of the Philippines Diliman majoring in Applied Physics, as well as an undergraduate researcher in the [Video and Image Processing](http://sites.google.com/site/instrumentationphysicslab/research/vip) subgroup of the [Instrumentation Physics Laboratory](http://sites.google.com/site/instrumentationphysicslab/), National Institute of Physics. I’m also an avid scuba diver.

You can find me on twitter, [@devential](http://twitter.com/devential), and on [GitHub](http://github.com/devential).
