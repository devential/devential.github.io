Listed are sets of both papers I've authored, class requirements I've made available online, and personal projects I've done. All of these range over the topics of machine learning, digital image processing, optical simulation, and big data analysis.

### Coursework
- [**Applied Physics 186**](/AP186/) - An undergraduate class instructed by Prof. Soriano on digital image processing which I took during my undergrad at NIP; two years later I was assigned as the laboratory instructor of the same class as part of my teaching load in the first semester of AY2018-19. Part of the course requirements at the time was a blog write-up for each of the activities on video and image processing techniques, with a self-evaluation at the end. The sets of activities have change slightly in the years since I took the class, but I intend to leave the blogs up on my website as a resource for future students of the class. 
- **Detection of a Rubikâ€™s cube state using parametric color segmentation in NCC and YCbCr color space** - My final project for AP186, implemented in MATLAB. [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZenpLAJejJVPhblgEko7fAVt1Jwo6HMj/edit), [Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17qMT-u-GC3LKkXlyAOQ6tKl0ejvlNAiW/)
